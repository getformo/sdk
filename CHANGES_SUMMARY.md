# Event Deduplication Fix - Summary of Changes

## Overview
Fixed an issue where custom events could be sent multiple times due to inadequate deduplication across flush cycles.

## Files Modified

### 1. `/src/lib/queue/EventQueue.ts`
**Changes:**
- Changed `payloadHashes` from `Set<string>` to `Map<string, number>` to track timestamps
- Added `DEDUPLICATION_WINDOW_MS` constant (60 seconds)
- Updated `generateMessageId()` to use second-level precision instead of minute-level
- Rewrote `isDuplicate()` to:
  - Clean up old hashes based on time window
  - Provide detailed warning messages when duplicates are detected
  - Use timestamp-based cleanup instead of clearing on flush
- Removed `payloadHashes.clear()` from `flush()` method
- Updated comments to explain the new behavior

**Impact:** Prevents duplicate events from being sent across flush cycles while maintaining proper deduplication within a 60-second window.

## Files Created

### 1. `/DEDUPLICATION_FIX.md`
Comprehensive documentation explaining:
- The problem and root causes
- The solution and technical details
- Testing recommendations
- Migration notes
- Debug tips

### 2. `/test/lib/queue/EventQueue.spec.ts`
Complete test suite covering:
- Basic deduplication (same second, different properties)
- Time-based deduplication (within/outside 60s window)
- Cross-flush deduplication
- Hash cleanup
- Real-world scenarios (transaction flows)

### 3. `/CHANGES_SUMMARY.md` (this file)
Summary of all changes made.

## Technical Details

### Before
```
Timeline:
10:30:15 - Event "transaction_submit" → Queued (hash: abc123)
10:30:25 - Flush triggered → payloadHashes.clear()
10:30:45 - Same event → Queued again (hash set was cleared)
```

### After
```
Timeline:
10:30:15 - Event "transaction_submit" → Queued (hash: abc123, timestamp: 10:30:15)
10:30:25 - Flush triggered → Hash set preserved
10:30:45 - Same event → BLOCKED! "Duplicate event detected, sent 30s ago"
10:31:20 - Same event → Allowed (outside 60s window)
```

## Breaking Changes
None. This is a backward-compatible improvement.

## Configuration
The deduplication window can be adjusted by modifying the constant in `EventQueue.ts`:
```typescript
const DEDUPLICATION_WINDOW_MS = 1_000 * 60; // 60 seconds (default)
```

## Testing
All existing tests pass. New comprehensive test suite added.

Run tests with:
```bash
yarn test
```

## Build Status
✅ CJS build: Success
✅ Tests: All passing (19 tests)
✅ Linter: No errors

## Recommendations for Users

1. **Enable SDK logging** to see deduplication warnings:
```typescript
const analytics = await FormoAnalytics.init(writeKey, {
  logger: {
    enabled: true,
    levels: ['warn', 'error', 'info']
  }
});
```

2. **Review integration code** if seeing many duplicate warnings:
   - Check for event handlers that fire multiple times
   - Look for state updates that trigger duplicate events
   - Consider adding unique identifiers to events (e.g., transaction hash)

3. **Monitor event counts** after deploying this fix to verify the reduction in duplicate events

## Next Steps

1. Test in a staging environment with real event flows
2. Monitor logs for duplicate event warnings
3. Deploy to production
4. Verify reduction in event volume in analytics dashboard
5. Update SDK version in projects using it

## Version Bump Suggestion
This should be a **PATCH** version bump (e.g., 1.20.0 → 1.20.1) as it's a bug fix with no breaking changes.
