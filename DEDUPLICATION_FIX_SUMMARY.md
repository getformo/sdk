# Event Deduplication Fix - Complete Summary

## Problem Statement

Users were experiencing an excess of custom events being sent by the Formo Analytics SDK. For example, a single transaction flow (submit → success/error) was generating far more events than expected (e.g., 9000 submits but many more successes/errors).

## Root Cause Analysis

The SDK's deduplication mechanism had **four critical bugs**:

### Bug #1: Hash Cleared on Every Flush ❌
```typescript
// BEFORE: Hash map cleared after every flush
async flush() {
  // ... send events ...
  this.payloadHashes.clear(); // ❌ Cleared deduplication state!
}
```
**Impact**: Duplicate events sent within the same 60-second window would NOT be deduplicated if a flush occurred between them.

### Bug #2: Timing Inconsistency ❌
```typescript
// BEFORE: Inconsistent time sources
generateMessageId() {
  // Used event.original_timestamp for hash
}

isDuplicate() {
  // Used Date.now() for time window
}
```
**Impact**: Events with past/future `original_timestamp` values wouldn't be deduplicated correctly. The 60s window was measured from current system time, but the hash was based on the event's timestamp.

### Bug #3: Out-of-Order Events ❌
```typescript
// BEFORE: Cleanup used event timestamp
isDuplicate(eventId, eventTimestamp) {
  // Clean up using eventTimestamp
  if (eventTimestamp - storedTimestamp > 60s) {
    delete hash; // ❌ Wrong reference point!
  }
}
```
**Impact**: When older events arrived after newer ones, cleanup would use the older timestamp as reference, incorrectly deleting hashes that should still be valid.

**Example**:
```
10:31:00 → Event A arrives (timestamp: 10:31:00)
10:31:05 → Event B arrives (timestamp: 10:30:00) ← Older!
           Cleanup uses 10:30:00, deletes hashes < 09:29:00
           But should keep hashes until 09:30:00 based on Event A!
```

### Bug #4: Memory Leak - No Cleanup Without Events ❌
```typescript
// BEFORE: Cleanup only in isDuplicate()
private async isDuplicate(eventId: string): Promise<boolean> {
  // Clean up old hashes...
  // But this only runs when NEW events arrive!
}

async flush() {
  // No cleanup here!
}
```
**Impact**: If events stop arriving, expired hashes are never removed from memory. In long-running applications with sporadic event activity, this could accumulate thousands of expired hashes, causing a memory leak.

**Example**:
```
10:30:00 → Event arrives, hash stored
10:30:30 → Event arrives, hash stored
10:31:00 → Last event arrives, hash stored
... 2 hours pass with no events ...
           All 3 hashes still in memory! ❌
           Should have been cleaned up after 60s
```

## Solution Architecture

### Core Principle: Separation of Concerns

1. **Hash Generation** = Event Identity (uses event data + timestamp)
2. **Deduplication** = Duplicate Detection (checks hash equality)
3. **Cleanup** = Memory Management (uses real elapsed time)

### Implementation

#### 1. Hash Generation (Event Identity)
```typescript
private async generateMessageId(event: IFormoEvent): Promise<string> {
  // Format timestamp to second precision for consistent hashing
  const date = new Date(event.original_timestamp);
  const formattedTimestamp = 
    date.getUTCFullYear() + "-" +
    ("0" + (date.getUTCMonth() + 1)).slice(-2) + "-" +
    ("0" + date.getUTCDate()).slice(-2) + " " +
    ("0" + date.getUTCHours()).slice(-2) + ":" +
    ("0" + date.getUTCMinutes()).slice(-2) + ":" +
    ("0" + date.getUTCSeconds()).slice(-2);
  
  const eventForHashing = { ...event, original_timestamp: formattedTimestamp };
  return await hash(JSON.stringify(eventForHashing));
}
```

**Key Points**:
- Hash based on event data + event timestamp (rounded to seconds)
- Same event at same time = same hash
- Different timestamp = different hash (different event)

#### 2. Deduplication Logic (Duplicate Detection)
```typescript
async enqueue(event: IFormoEvent, callback?: (...args: any) => void) {
  const message_id = await this.generateMessageId(event);
  
  if (await this.isDuplicate(message_id)) {
    // Duplicate detected - block it
    return;
  }
  
  // Enqueue the event
  this.queue.push({ message: { ...event, message_id }, callback });
}
```

**Key Points**:
- Simple hash equality check
- If seen recently (within 60s real time), block it

#### 3. Cleanup & Storage (Memory Management)
```typescript
/**
 * Separate cleanup method that can be called from multiple places
 */
private cleanupOldHashes(): void {
  const now = Date.now();
  
  // CLEANUP: Remove old hashes based on REAL elapsed time
  const hashesToDelete: string[] = [];
  this.payloadHashes.forEach((storedTimestamp, hash) => {
    if (now - storedTimestamp > DEDUPLICATION_WINDOW_MS) {
      hashesToDelete.push(hash);
    }
  });
  hashesToDelete.forEach(hash => this.payloadHashes.delete(hash));
}

private async isDuplicate(eventId: string): Promise<boolean> {
  const now = Date.now();
  
  // CLEANUP: Clean up old hashes to prevent memory leaks
  this.cleanupOldHashes();
  
  // CHECK: Is this hash in recent memory?
  if (this.payloadHashes.has(eventId)) {
    const storedAt = this.payloadHashes.get(eventId)!;
    const elapsedRealTime = now - storedAt;
    logger.warn(`Duplicate event detected and blocked. Same event was first seen ${Math.round(elapsedRealTime / 1000)}s ago.`);
    return true;
  }

  // STORE: Remember this hash with current real time
  this.payloadHashes.set(eventId, now);
  return false;
}
```

**Key Points**:
- Cleanup extracted to separate `cleanupOldHashes()` method
- Cleanup based on `Date.now()` (real time elapsed)
- Storage uses `Date.now()` (when we first saw it)
- Deduplication window = 60 seconds of real time since first seen
- Hash map is **never cleared** - only time-based cleanup

#### 4. Periodic Cleanup on Flush ✅
```typescript
async flush(callback?: (...args: any) => void) {
  // ... clear timer ...
  
  // CLEANUP: Run periodic cleanup to prevent memory leaks
  // This ensures cleanup happens even when no new events arrive
  this.cleanupOldHashes();
  
  if (!this.queue.length) {
    return Promise.resolve();
  }
  
  // ... send events ...
  // Note: payloadHashes is NOT cleared - only time-based cleanup
}
```

**Key Points**:
- Cleanup runs on every flush cycle (default: every 10 seconds)
- Prevents memory leaks in long-running apps with sporadic events
- No additional timers needed - leverages existing flush interval
- Works even when queue is empty

## What Changed

| Aspect | Before | After |
|--------|--------|-------|
| **Hash generation** | event.original_timestamp | ✅ event.original_timestamp (same) |
| **Hash precision** | Minute-level | ✅ **Second-level** |
| **Hash cleared on flush** | ❌ Yes (cleared) | ✅ **No (preserved)** |
| **Cleanup time source** | ❌ Inconsistent/event time | ✅ **Date.now() (real time)** |
| **Storage time source** | ❌ Inconsistent | ✅ **Date.now() (real time)** |
| **Deduplication window** | ❌ Broken across flushes | ✅ **60s real-time window** |
| **Out-of-order events** | ❌ Broken | ✅ **Handled correctly** |
| **Memory leak prevention** | ❌ No cleanup without events | ✅ **Periodic cleanup on flush** |
| **Test coverage** | ❌ No assertions | ✅ **Comprehensive tests** |

## How It Works

### Example Flow

```typescript
// Event arrives at real-time 10:31:00
const event = {
  type: "track",
  event: "transaction_submit",
  original_timestamp: "2025-01-01T10:30:00Z",
  properties: { type: "swap" }
}

// 1. Generate hash (based on event data + timestamp)
const hash = generateMessageId(event);
// hash = "abc123..." (includes 10:30:00 in the hash)

// 2. Check if duplicate
if (!payloadHashes.has("abc123")) {
  // 3. Store with real time (when first seen)
  payloadHashes.set("abc123", 10:31:00); // Real time!
  // 4. Enqueue
}

// 15 seconds later: Same event arrives (10:31:15)
// Hash is still "abc123" (same event data + timestamp)
// payloadHashes.has("abc123") = true
// Elapsed: 10:31:15 - 10:31:00 = 15s < 60s
// BLOCKED as duplicate ✅

// 61 seconds later: Same event arrives (10:32:01)
// Cleanup runs: 10:32:01 - 10:31:00 = 61s > 60s
// Hash "abc123" deleted
// Now allowed through ✅
```

## Edge Cases Handled

### ✅ Out-of-Order Events
```typescript
10:31:00 → Event A (timestamp: 10:31:00) arrives
10:31:05 → Event B (timestamp: 10:30:00) arrives ← Older!

// Different timestamps → different hashes → both allowed
// Cleanup uses real-time → works correctly
```

### ✅ Rapid Duplicates
```typescript
// User clicks button 5 times in 1 second
for (let i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
  track("transaction_submit", { type: "swap" });
}

// All have same hash
// First: stored
// Rest: blocked ✅
```

### ✅ Cross-Flush Persistence
```typescript
10:30:00 → Event queued (hash stored)
10:30:25 → Flush triggered (hash preserved!)
10:30:45 → Duplicate blocked (hash still there)
10:31:05 → Hash cleaned up (65s elapsed)
```

### ✅ Transaction Lifecycle
```typescript
// Real-world scenario
10:30:00 → transaction_submit (allowed)
10:30:00 → transaction_submit (blocked - duplicate!)
10:30:05 → transaction_success (allowed - different event)
10:30:05 → transaction_success (blocked - duplicate!)
```

## Test Coverage

```

## Impact

### Before Fix
- ❌ Duplicate events sent frequently
- ❌ 9000 submits could generate many more success/error events
- ❌ Deduplication broken across flushes
- ❌ Out-of-order events handled incorrectly
- ❌ Unpredictable behavior

### After Fix
- ✅ Robust deduplication within 60s window
- ✅ Consistent behavior across flushes
- ✅ Correct handling of all edge cases
- ✅ Predictable real-time-based deduplication
- ✅ Production-ready

## Key Takeaways

1. **Hash = Event Identity**: Based on event data + timestamp
2. **Window = Real Time**: 60 seconds since we first saw the hash
3. **Cleanup = Memory Management**: Remove hashes after 60s of real time
4. **Never Clear Hash Map**: Only time-based cleanup, no manual clearing
5. **Periodic Cleanup**: Runs on flush to prevent memory leaks

## Deduplication Semantics

**"An event is considered a duplicate if it has the same data and timestamp as an event we've seen within the last 60 seconds of real time."**

This means:
- Same event can be sent again after 60 seconds ✅
- Different timestamps = different events ✅
- Works with out-of-order events ✅
- Persists across flushes ✅
- Memory-efficient with automatic cleanup ✅
