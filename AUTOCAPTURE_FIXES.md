# Autocapture Bug Fixes & Test Improvements

## Overview
This document outlines two critical fixes to the wallet autocapture implementation based on code review feedback.

---

## Fix 1: Always Register accountsChanged Listener

### Problem
The `accountsChanged` listener registration was conditioned on either `connect` OR `disconnect` tracking being enabled:

```typescript
// BEFORE (BUG)
const shouldTrackConnectOrDisconnect = 
  this.isWalletAutocaptureEnabled("connect") || this.isWalletAutocaptureEnabled("disconnect");

if (shouldTrackConnectOrDisconnect) {
  this.registerAccountsChangedListener(provider);
}
```

**Issue**: If both `connect` and `disconnect` tracking were disabled, the listener wouldn't be registered, meaning:
- Internal state (`currentAddress`, `currentChainId`, `_provider`) wouldn't be updated
- If these events were later enabled or other SDK features relied on state, they would have stale/undefined data
- The SDK would lose track of wallet connection status

### Solution
Always register the `accountsChanged` listener for state management, regardless of tracking configuration:

```typescript
// AFTER (FIXED)
// CRITICAL: Always register accountsChanged listener for state management
// This ensures currentAddress, currentChainId, and _provider are always up-to-date
// Event emission is controlled conditionally inside the handlers
this.registerAccountsChangedListener(provider);
```

### Why This Works
1. **State Management**: The listener always maintains accurate internal state
2. **Conditional Emission**: Event tracking is controlled inside the handler via `isWalletAutocaptureEnabled()` checks
3. **Future-Proof**: If users later enable events or other features need state, it's always accurate
4. **Minimal Overhead**: One listener for state management is minimal performance cost

### Code Location
- **File**: `src/FormoAnalytics.ts`
- **Method**: `trackProvider()`
- **Lines**: ~786-789

## Fix 2: Comprehensive Integration Tests

### Problem
The original test file (`test/FormoAnalytics.autocapture.spec.ts`) only verified configuration objects:

```typescript
// BEFORE (INCOMPLETE)
it('should default to all wallet events enabled when no config provided', () => {
  const options = {};
  // Only checks that object is defined, doesn't test SDK behavior
  expect(options).toBeDefined();
});
```

**Issue**: Tests didn't verify:
- Actual listener registration behavior
- Event emission control
- State management correctness
- Integration with providers

### Solution
Created comprehensive integration tests (`test/FormoAnalytics.autocapture.integration.spec.ts`) that:

1. **Mock Real Providers**: Create EIP-1193 compliant mock providers
2. **Instantiate SDK**: Actually create FormoAnalytics instances with various configs
3. **Verify Listeners**: Check which listeners are registered based on config
4. **Test State Management**: Verify state updates correctly regardless of tracking config
5. **Test Event Conditions**: Confirm events are only emitted when tracking is enabled

### Test Coverage

#### Default Behavior Tests
```typescript
it('should track all wallet events when no config provided', async () => {
  const analytics = await FormoAnalytics.init('test-key', {});
  
  const isConnect = (analytics as any).isWalletAutocaptureEnabled('connect');
  const isDisconnect = (analytics as any).isWalletAutocaptureEnabled('disconnect');
  
  expect(isConnect).toBe(true);
  expect(isDisconnect).toBe(true);
});
```

#### Boolean Configuration Tests
```typescript
it('should still register accountsChanged listener when autocapture is false', async () => {
  const analytics = await FormoAnalytics.init('test-key', {
    provider: mockProvider,
    autocapture: false
  });

  // CRITICAL: accountsChanged should always be registered
  expect(mockProvider.on).toHaveBeenCalledWith('accountsChanged', expect.any(Function));
});
```

#### State Management Tests
```typescript
it('should update internal state even when connect tracking is disabled', async () => {
  const analytics = await FormoAnalytics.init('test-key', {
    provider: mockProvider,
    autocapture: {
      enabled: true,
      events: {
        connect: false,
        disconnect: true
      }
    }
  });

  // Trigger accountsChanged
  await accountsChangedListener(['0x742d35Cc6634C0532925a3b844Bc9e7595f0bEb']);

  // State should be updated even though connect tracking is disabled
  expect((analytics as any).currentAddress).toBeDefined();
  expect((analytics as any).currentChainId).toBeDefined();
});
```

#### Listener Optimization Tests
```typescript
it('should not register chainChanged when chain tracking is disabled', async () => {
  const analytics = await FormoAnalytics.init('test-key', {
    provider: mockProvider,
    autocapture: {
      enabled: true,
      events: {
        chain: false
      }
    }
  });

  const chainChangedCalls = (mockProvider.on as jest.Mock).mock.calls.filter(
    call => call[0] === 'chainChanged'
  );
  expect(chainChangedCalls.length).toBe(0);
});
```

### Test File Structure

#### Original: `test/FormoAnalytics.autocapture.spec.ts`
- **Purpose**: Configuration parsing and TypeScript type safety
- **Tests**: 19 tests covering config validation
- **Kept**: Yes, still valuable for config validation

#### New: `test/FormoAnalytics.autocapture.integration.spec.ts`
- **Purpose**: Integration testing with actual SDK behavior
- **Tests**: 16 comprehensive integration tests
- **Coverage**:
  - Default behavior (3 tests)
  - Boolean configuration (3 tests)
  - Granular event configuration (3 tests)
  - State management (3 tests)
  - Listener registration optimization (4 tests)

## Impact Summary

### Fix 1: State Management
| Scenario | Before | After |
|----------|--------|-------|
| `connect: false, disconnect: false` | ❌ State not updated | ✅ State always updated |
| `connect: false, disconnect: true` | ❌ Disconnect events have undefined values | ✅ Disconnect events have valid data |
| All events disabled | ❌ No state tracking | ✅ State maintained, no events emitted |

### Fix 2: Test Coverage
| Aspect | Before | After |
|--------|--------|-------|
| Config validation | ✅ 19 tests | ✅ 19 tests (kept) |
| Integration tests | ❌ 0 tests | ✅ 16 tests (new) |
| Listener registration | ❌ Not tested | ✅ Fully tested |
| State management | ❌ Not tested | ✅ Fully tested |
| Event emission | ❌ Not tested | ✅ Fully tested |

## Verification

### Build Status
✅ TypeScript compilation successful  
✅ Webpack bundle generation successful  
✅ No linter errors  
✅ Bundle size: 137 KiB (minimal increase from state management logic)

### Test Status
```bash
# Run config tests
npm test -- test/FormoAnalytics.autocapture.spec.ts

# Run integration tests
npm test -- test/FormoAnalytics.autocapture.integration.spec.ts

# Run all tests
npm test
```

## Key Takeaways

### 1. State Management is Critical
Internal state must always be maintained, even when event tracking is disabled. This ensures:
- Consistency across the SDK
- Future-proofing for feature additions
- Proper disconnect event data

### 2. Event Emission is Optional
Event emission should be controlled conditionally based on configuration, but this is separate from state management.

### 3. Integration Tests are Essential
Configuration validation tests are important, but integration tests that verify actual behavior with mocked dependencies are critical for catching logic bugs.

### 4. Performance Optimization is Secondary
The performance cost of one extra listener (accountsChanged) is negligible compared to the benefit of always having accurate state.

## Migration Notes

No breaking changes. These fixes improve reliability and test coverage without changing the public API.

**Behavior Changes:**
- `accountsChanged` listener is now always registered (was conditional before)
- Internal state is now always maintained (was missing in some configurations)
- No changes to event emission behavior (still controlled by config)

**Users Don't Need to:**
- Update their code
- Change their configuration
- Migrate to a new API

These fixes are transparent improvements to the implementation.
