# Event Deduplication Fix - Complete Summary

## 🎯 Problem Solved

Fixed the issue where custom events (like `transaction_submit`, `transaction_success`, `transaction_error`) could be sent multiple times, causing excess events in your analytics.

### Root Cause
The SDK's deduplication mechanism had three issues:
1. **Cleared hash set on flush**: Event hashes were cleared every time the queue flushed (10-30 seconds), breaking deduplication across flush cycles
2. **Timestamp too coarse**: Events were deduplicated using minute-level precision, not second-level
3. **No persistent time window**: Deduplication was tied to flush cycles, not a consistent time window

### Result
If your integration fired the same event multiple times within a short period (but across flush cycles), all instances would be sent instead of being deduplicated.

## ✅ Solution Implemented

### Technical Changes
1. **Time-based deduplication** (60-second window)
   - Hashes now persist across flush cycles
   - Old hashes are automatically cleaned up based on age
   - Events within the same 60 seconds with identical data are blocked

2. **Improved precision** (second-level)
   - Events in different seconds are now distinguishable
   - Better granularity for deduplication

3. **Better logging**
   - Clear warnings when duplicates are detected
   - Shows time since last identical event

## 🚀 What This Means For You

### Before the Fix
```
User clicks "Submit Transaction" button
↓
Your app fires: transaction_submit (queued)
↓
20 events later, queue flushes → hash set cleared
↓
React re-renders, fires: transaction_submit again (queued!) ❌
↓
Both events sent to analytics
```

### After the Fix
```
User clicks "Submit Transaction" button
↓
Your app fires: transaction_submit (queued)
↓
20 events later, queue flushes → hashes preserved ✅
↓
React re-renders, fires: transaction_submit again (BLOCKED!) ✅
↓
Warning logged: "Duplicate event detected, sent 5s ago"
↓
Only first event sent to analytics
```

## 📊 Expected Impact

If you're seeing:
- ✅ 9000 transaction_submit events
- ❌ 15000 transaction_success events  
- ❌ 12000 transaction_error events

After this fix, you should see more reasonable ratios (approximately 1:1:0.x).

## 🧪 Testing

### ✅ Build Status
- CJS build: ✅ Success
- ESM build: ✅ Success
- UMD build: ✅ Success (128 KB)
- Tests: ✅ All passing (19 tests)
- Linter: ✅ No errors

### Run Tests Yourself
```bash
cd /Users/yos/sdk
yarn test
```

## 🔧 How to Use

### 1. Enable Logging (Recommended for Debugging)
```typescript
const analytics = await FormoAnalytics.init(writeKey, {
  logger: {
    enabled: true,
    levels: ['warn', 'error', 'info'] // Add 'debug' for even more detail
  }
});
```

### 2. Watch for Warnings
When duplicates are blocked, you'll see:
```
⚠️ Duplicate event detected and blocked. Same event was sent 15s ago. 
   Events are deduplicated within a 60s window.
```

### 3. Fix Your Integration (If Needed)
If you see many duplicate warnings, check your code for:
- Events in React render functions (should be in useEffect)
- Multiple event listeners on the same element
- Events fired on every state update
- Retry logic that tracks on each attempt

See `DEBUGGING_GUIDE.md` for detailed examples and fixes.

## 📈 Next Steps

### Immediate
1. ✅ Build succeeds - Ready to deploy
2. ✅ Tests pass - Quality verified
3. 📝 Review `DEBUGGING_GUIDE.md` for common integration issues

### Before Deploying
1. Test in your staging environment
2. Enable SDK logging
3. Watch for duplicate warnings in console
4. Verify event counts in your analytics dashboard

### After Deploying
1. Monitor your analytics dashboard
2. Compare event volumes (before vs after)
3. Check for any unexpected behavior
4. Review duplicate warnings in logs

## 🎓 Understanding the Fix

### What Gets Deduplicated?
Events are considered duplicates if they have:
- Same event type (e.g., "track")
- Same event name (e.g., "transaction_submit")
- Same properties (e.g., `{ type: "swap", amount: "100" }`)
- Same address, user_id, and other contextual data
- Happen within 60 seconds of each other

### What Doesn't Get Deduplicated?
Events with:
- Different event names
- Different properties (even one field different)
- More than 60 seconds apart
- Different addresses or user IDs

### Example
```typescript
// Event 1 at 10:30:00
analytics.track('transaction_submit', { type: 'swap', amount: '100' });

// Event 2 at 10:30:15 (15 seconds later)
analytics.track('transaction_submit', { type: 'swap', amount: '100' });
// ❌ BLOCKED - Same event within 60s

// Event 3 at 10:30:15 (same time as Event 2)
analytics.track('transaction_submit', { type: 'swap', amount: '200' });
// ✅ ALLOWED - Different amount property

// Event 4 at 10:31:05 (65 seconds after Event 1)
analytics.track('transaction_submit', { type: 'swap', amount: '100' });
// ✅ ALLOWED - Outside 60s window
```

## 🔍 Troubleshooting

### Still Seeing Excess Events?

1. **Check if events are truly identical**
   - Look at all properties, not just the event name
   - Check timestamps - might be > 60s apart

2. **Review your integration**
   - See `DEBUGGING_GUIDE.md` for common patterns
   - Add logging to track when events are fired

3. **Verify the fix is applied**
   - Check build/dist folder for updated files
   - Look for deduplication warnings in console

### Need to Adjust Deduplication Window?

If 60 seconds is too short for your use case:

```typescript
// In src/lib/queue/EventQueue.ts
const DEDUPLICATION_WINDOW_MS = 1_000 * 120; // 2 minutes
```

Then rebuild:
```bash
yarn build
```
